# 🎓 Alumni Web Programming

A web platform built for the Web Programming course to connect graduates with their alma mater. The goal is to give alumni a place to keep their career info up to date and give the institution a simple way to track alumni outcomes over time. The project is under active, incremental development, with each course milestone adding a new capability on top of the last.

## 🚀 Key Features (Planned & In Progress)

- **Alumni Directory:** Basic profile and listing endpoints for graduates.
- **Greeting & Utility Endpoints:** Early API building blocks (`/hello`, `/sum`, etc.) used to learn and validate the routing layer.
- **Static Pages:** Home and About pages describing the project.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker & Docker Compose setup so the app runs identically on any machine.
- **Future Milestones:** Alumni profile management, search/filtering, and a persistent database layer will be added in upcoming weeks.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Framework:** Flask
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed (recommended way to run this project)
- Python 3.12 (only needed for the local, non-Docker alternative)

## How to Run (Recommended: Docker Compose)

Run these exact commands from the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The app will start and be available at `http://localhost:5000`. Stop it with `Ctrl+C`, then `docker compose down`.

## Alternative: Run Locally with Python

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
